My club would meet to play various card games such as Trumps or Egyptian War and enjoy snacks that I would provide. The entrance fee would always be a short note of gratitude to a selected person in our community that we wanted to show appreciation for. An example of someone we wrote to was our beloved librarian Aunty Gabes, who was retiring.
