Working with FitRM, I helped run a weekly basketball clinic for high school athletes. It was a challenge for me. I'm naturally an introverted person, so I had to step out of my comfort zone and be a leader for these young athletes. I had to learn to be confident, and be authoritative. I have played basketball my whole life, but I quickly learned it is much different to teach something even if you are comfortable and/or good at it.

I'm grateful for this experience as it has taught me how to present myself as a leader and role model. It has helped me grow as a coach for the high school team that I assistant coach at Kaiser High School. I've also brought the leadership skills I learned into other areas of my life; I am now a much more confident individual, which has made me more driven to attack the things I want to do. I started to independently learn some coding languages and techniques, I started a garden, and I started lifting weights much more regularly than I used to.
