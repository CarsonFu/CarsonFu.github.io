<p><em>Javascript: uncharted territory for me</em></p>

<p>I have no knowledge or experience with Javascript prior to taking ICS 314. At first I was intimidated by this fact. I was concerned that I might have a hard time adapting to the new language and that my lack of experience might hold me back in the class.</p>

<p>However, I’ve found my transition into learning Javascript to be somewhat smooth. My first impressions of coding with Javascript thus far are mostly positive: I think that Javascript is an intuitive language with clean syntax, interactivity, and versatility. For these reasons, I look forward to learning about Javascript in more depth.</p>

<h2 id="intuitiveness">Intuitiveness</h2>

<p>Despite being completely new to Javascript, I have found it to be surprisingly much more intuitive and easier to learn than other programming languages that I have worked with in the past, such as C++ and Java.</p>

<p>I like how functions are first class objects, which can expedite the coding process and even make functions easier to implement and utilize; because they are first class objects, functions can be stored in variables, passed as an argument to another function, and returned from a function. This allows for more creativity when using functions in code. This also can make the coding process more efficient by using less lines of code to complete the same task.</p>

<p>I also like how Javascript seems to be “smarter” than other coding languages such as C++ since it can assume the data type of variables for you. Instead of having to create variables with set data types, you can just create variables that will accept whatever data type you give it. This makes variables more versatile as they can be used in various different situations without having to create new ones every time you need to use a new data type.</p>

<h2 id="interactiveness">Interactiveness</h2>

<p>Javascript is an extremely popular language when it comes to web development. The reason for this is because it is a dynamic language. Unlike Java, it doesn’t need to be compiled on the same server it was created. Instead, Javascript is interpreted on the user’s end. In fact, it is the only language that can be interpreted by web browsers.</p>

<p>This is what makes it a good language for use with web development; it allows for a better experience for users of web pages because it can interact more with them. It’s exciting to think about how much there is to learn about Javascript and what it can do, because web development has always been an interest of mine.</p>

<h2 id="versatility">Versatility</h2>

<p>Another big reason for Javascript’s popularity in web development is its versatility. It’s mainly used for frontend development, but it can also be used for backend development. This means it can be used to work on both the client-end and server side of web pages. Therefore, Javascript is such a powerful tool for making dynamic websites.</p>

<p>Another reason it is so popular for web development is that it is a loosely typed language; it is easier to learn and use and empowers a larger group of people to create applications on the internet. The only downside of it being loosely typed is that its performance isn’t great on larger applications, thus it is mainly used for small applications.</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-explore">Ready to explore!</h2>

<p>Javascript is a great coding language for web development because it is intuitive, dynamic, and versatile. I’m looking forward to learning more about it throughout the course of taking ICS 314 and hope to harness its power to create my own small application soon.</p>

<p>Javascript appears to be a good steppingstone for learners who want to get their feet wet in web development, and that’s exactly where I’m at. I’m excited to learn to master the powerful tool that is Javascript!</p>
