## Design patterns were introduced in middle school

  Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise when sotware engineering. They make our life easier when we code, since they can provide a simple, easily manipulated foundation for when we start a new project/application. In class we used templates in Meteor such as meteor-template-react and meteor-form-react. 

## Conclusion

  In conclusion, AI is an intriguing new tool that can turbocharge the learning of software engineering. However, with great power comes great responsibility. It must be used correctly. AI can do a lot of things, but it cannot think for you at the end of the day. You can't let AI do the thinking for you. You can let it teach you small concepts so that you can do the thinking on your own. Once you let AI think for you, it's almost as if you are giving it control. I believe that one day AI will take over the world because we will become to dependent on it. Luckily, today is not that day so let's use it to learn as much as we can while we still can!
